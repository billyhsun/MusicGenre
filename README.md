# MusicGenre
MIE324 Deep Learning Project

A music genre classifier trained using deep learning and neural networks, that outputs the predicted genre and confidence level (0-1) of any piece of mp3 audio sample. 

The UI allows the user to enter a YouTube link of the song before downloading it internally, or upload an mp3 file, and automatically outputs the confidence level in each genre (shown below).
